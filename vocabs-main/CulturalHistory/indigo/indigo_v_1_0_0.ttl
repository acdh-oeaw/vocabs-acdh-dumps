    skos:editorialNote "The \"activity\" collection forms a cornerstone of the graffiti thesaurus, serving as a foundational category that encapsulates the diverse actions and processes integral to graffiti creation and appreciation. As a top-level concept, it stands independently, not falling under any broader category. The term \"activity\", within the graffiti context, is a broad umbrella under which specific actions contributing to the creation, distribution, or appreciation of graffiti reside. This includes techniques such as \"bombing\", \"scratching\", or \"spraying\". Each of these can be considered as a narrower concept, further refining the understanding of what constitutes an \"activity\" in the world of graffiti."@en ;
    skos:example "Examples of the \"activity\" collection bring to life the various processes involved in graffiti creation. \"Bombing\" represents a swift, expansive approach, where a graffitist covers a large area with quick, often simple, graffiti. \"Scratching\" provides a contrast, with the graffitist etching a design into a surface using a sharp object, creating a different kind of visual impact. Lastly, \"spraying\" exemplifies a common graffiti technique, where aerosol paint cans are used to apply paint in a controlled manner, crafting the graffito on the chosen surface."@en ;

These unintentional drips typically result from a lack of control over the spray can, which can lead to an excess of paint being applied to the surface. This excess paint then drips down the surface, creating streaks that can disrupt the intended design of the graffito.\r
While some experienced graffitists may intentionally incorporate drips into their work as a stylistic choice, unintentional drips are generally seen as a sign of inexperience. They can detract from the overall appearance of the graffito, making it look messy or poorly executed. Therefore, gaining control over the spray can to prevent unintentional drips is often one of the first skills a new graffitist must master."""@en ;

While beginners can learn by copying techniques and styles from other graffitists, it is expected that they will eventually develop and create their own unique style. The term \"biting\" is derived from the slang term \"to bite\", meaning to steal or copy from someone else.

However, the use of the term predates Meulman's contributions by at least thirty years. It was used by Canadian painter Brion Gysin in his final exhibition, \"Calligraffiti of Fire,\" in 1986, and in a book about post-modernism by H.L. Hix in 1995.

Firstly, a memorial can be a graffito created specifically to remember or honour an individual. This is similar to a dedication, where the graffito serves as a tribute to a person, often someone who has passed away or is greatly respected within the community. Secondly, a memorial can also refer to a graffito that is actively preserved by the community in memory of a graffitist who has passed away, particularly if they died prematurely. In this case, the graffito itself becomes a symbol of remembrance, a testament to the graffitist's impact on the community and their contribution to the graffiti-scape. \r
It's important to note that the purpose of a graffito can change over time. A work that was not initially created as a memorial may become one of the graffitist it's associated with passes away. Similarly, a memorial graffito may gain new layers of meaning as it is preserved and interacted with by the community over time.It's important to note that the purpose of a graffito can change over time.

    skos:editorialNote """The "paint stencil" technique in graffiti refers to a method where a design, pattern, or image is cut out of thin material like paper, cardboard, or plastic to create a stencil. This stencil is then used as a guide to apply paint onto a surface, creating a reproducible and precise image. This technique is particularly popular in graffiti due to its simplicity, speed, and ability to create identical symbols, letters, or shapes.\r
In the context of graffiti, the paint stencil technique is often used to create a specific type of graffiti known as stencil graffiti. This form of graffiti is characterized by its sharp, well-defined images that can be quickly and easily reproduced, making it a popular choice for graffitists who want to disseminate their work widely and rapidly. Moreover, the paint stencil technique allows for a high degree of creativity. Graffitists can use multiple layers of paint or aerosol to create the illusion of depth, and the stencils themselves can range from simple to complex designs. This flexibility, combined with the technique's inherent speed and reproducibility, has made the paint stencil technique a mainstay in the world of graffiti."""@en ;

This style is often associated with street art and art itself, as it involves drawing something that looks as realistic as a picture or photograph. Photorealism originated as an art movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where artists would study a photograph and then attempt to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another medium. In the context of graffiti, the photorealistic style is often used to create intricate and lifelike representations of people, objects, or scenes on walls or other large surfaces. The photorealistic style requires a high level of technical skill and artistic prowess, as it involves accurately capturing the minute details, textures, lighting, and colours of the subject matter. This style of graffiti often has a powerful visual impact and can transform urban environments into immersive works of art."@en ;

A well-executed tag can demonstrate a graffitist's skill, creativity, and individuality.\r
Tagging is often associated with the act of "bombing", where a graffitist aims to create as many tags as possible in a single outing, covering a large area or highly visible locations.

These characters can range from human figures to animals, mythical creatures, or even abstract forms. They are typically stylised and can be either realistic or fantastical in nature.\r
In graffiti writing, characters often serve as secondary elements, complementing the main textual components such as tags, throw-ups, or pieces. They can add visual interest, enhance the narrative, or provide additional context to the graffito. Characters in graffiti writing can also serve as a signature or identifier for the graffitist, adding an extra layer of personalisation to their work. However, they are typically less prominent and less frequent compared to characters in street art. The creation of characters in graffiti writing requires a blend of skills, combining the stylistic elements of graffiti lettering with the principles of drawing and illustration."""@en ;

    skos:editorialNote "\"Outlines\" in the context of graffiti refers to the initial lines or contours that a graffitist uses to define the shape and structure of their work. These lines serve as a guide for the graffitist, helping them to plan the layout and composition of the graffiti before adding colour, shading, and other details. Outlines are a crucial part of the graffiti creation process, providing the foundation upon which the rest of the work is built. They are typically drawn using a contrasting colour to the fill-ins, helping to distinguish the individual elements of the graffiti and enhancing its visual impact. Outlines can vary in thickness and style, reflecting the graffitist's unique approach and the specific requirements of the work. They contribute to the overall aesthetic of the graffiti, playing a key role in defining its form and structure."@en ;

    skos:editorialNote """"Street art" is a sub-category of graffiti and represents a class of graffiti that is often more accepted by the general public and authorities compared to other forms of graffiti. While it shares many characteristics with traditional graffiti, such as the use of public spaces as a canvas and the often unauthorised nature of the work, street art tends to be more focused on aesthetics and public engagement.\r
Street art is often characterised by the use of a variety of media and techniques, including but not limited to murals, stencils, stickers, and installations. The works are often larger, more complex, and more time-consuming to create than traditional graffiti. They often feature intricate designs, detailed imagery, and sometimes even interactive elements. The graffitists who create street art often aim to engage with the public, provoke thought, or make a statement. While the act of creating street art can still be seen as rebellious or subversive, the intent is often more focused on the creation of a visually appealing or thought-provoking piece rather than the act of creation itself."""@en ;

    skos:editorialNote """'Writing', within the context of graffiti, refers to a movement that originated in the 1960s on the East Coast of the United States. This movement is characterised by its focus on text-based graffiti, often involving the use of stylised lettering and tags. The writing movement is more than just a type of graffito; it represents a cultural phenomenon that has had a significant impact on the evolution of the graffiti-scape. It incorporates not only the physical act of creating text-based graffiti but also the intangible aspects such as the culture, ethos, and community that surround this practice.\r
Key elements of the writing movement include styles, pieces, and tags. Styles refer to the unique lettering designs used by graffitists, pieces are larger and more complex works often involving multiple colours and intricate designs, and tags are the simplest form of graffiti, usually consisting of the graffitist's chosen name or signature.\r
While the writing movement has its roots in the US, it has since spread globally, influencing graffiti practices and cultures around the world. It underscores the power of graffiti as a form of communication and expression, and its capacity to transcend geographical and cultural boundaries."""@en ;
