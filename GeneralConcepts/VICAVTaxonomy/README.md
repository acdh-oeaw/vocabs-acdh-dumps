# VICAV Taxonomy of Arabic Dialects

used at https://vocabs.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/vicav_dialects_taxonomy/

see redmine issue 

created internally at ACDH-CH for the VICAV project using the vocabseditor and currently a post-processing step

currently the vocabseditor dump is not aligned with the dump that included some manual post-processing. there don't use the vocabseditor-dump, use the triplestoreexport-dump

post-processing work:
* replace usage of ISO-639-3 language tags with ISO-639-1 language tags (3 not supported in Skosmos): change "@ara" to "@ar" and "@tur" to "@tr"
